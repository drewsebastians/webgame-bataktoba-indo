## Latest verified merged-main checkpoint

- Repository visibility: PUBLIC. Current main/tree: ca7bc9842a57b0765d0b33b5bf517c4b5de485b5 / e6485a749114b9086b5e628270f5e2bb7546c21f. PR #23 (adapter) and PR #24 (checkpoint) are merged.
- Main Verify #108 / run 41257990728 passed on main: 211/211 unit tests (0 failed, 0 skipped), E2E smoke, 36/36 Playwright tests, JS/CSS budgets, committed-dist drift and 12 Lighthouse audits. Report artifact: https://github.com/drewsebastians/webgame-bataktoba-indo/actions/runs/41257990728/artifacts/13063919161.
- Lighthouse accessibility scored 100/100 across every route/profile. Mobile performance: home 99, angka 92, games 98, flashcards 90, dictionary 93, progress 100. Desktop: home 100, angka 99, games 100, flashcards 100, dictionary 100, progress 100.
- The fail-closed adapter preserves part of speech, orthography, example-use reference, context note, alternatives, sense, topics, provenance and per-game eligibility. Adapter tests use synthetic-only fixtures.
- Cloudflare Workers Builds reported success for this exact main SHA in its production service: build 191555d0-5483-4ca9-a0f6-e4fa0d597d5c, version 45ae3539-c79c-49ec-aa83-8041d9d9cb10. This verifies provider build/deployment status. Direct readback of home, dictionary, robots.txt and manifest remains unavailable through connected browser surfaces, so the live artifact is not marked production-verified.
- Main verification measured 0 published learning items, 0 words, 0 genuine phrases, 0 sentences and 0 warnings. Synthetic fixtures remain test-only; no private/restricted text was transferred and public Git history was not rewritten.

## Readiness gates

| Gate | State | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| ENGINEERING_READY | YES for the merged adapter and synthetic/browser verification scope; wider A3 work continues | Main Verify #108 passed unit, smoke, browser, budget, Lighthouse and drift gates. |
| DATA_READY | NO | No approved learning records are available for public consumption. |
| PUBLICATION_READY | NO | No verified record-level publication rights and upstream scope grant. |
| LEARNING_READY | NO | Production repository data is empty; synthetic tests do not establish real-content readiness. |
| MONETIZATION_READY | DEFERRED | Separate future gate, not a current priority. |

## Resume actions

1. Re-fetch both repositories, visibility, main/tree, Issues, PRs, Actions, deployment state and private latest.json before the next write batch.
2. Continue A3 browser work independently: responsive UX, PWA/offline, accessibility, privacy/security and route performance.
3. Retry direct live artifact inspection when an available browser surface can reach the configured Pages host.
4. Keep public content empty/noindex and fixtures synthetic until source rights and quality gates pass; continue private research only in the PRIVATE engine.
